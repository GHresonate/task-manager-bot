# task-manager-bot
> In progress

It will be a Telegram bot that can help with task management. For now only registration and account management are finished, and I started the part with the task management.
## What`s the plan?
*1) Create docker and docker-compose files:* it can make deployment easier, if I start to work with containers in the middle, then in the end of development, also this can help with debugging and development;

*2) Create CI/CD:* I can automate app updating with some kind of CI/CD, with this I can automate app updating after commits, without a need to revise it manually;

*3) Finish the bot:* well... because the bot actually is the main goal of the development;

*4) Create the infrastructure and deploy:* create infra for this bot in a cloud via terraform, and deploy it to the server;
